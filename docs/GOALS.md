# Goals

## Phase 2 Goals — Language + ABI Lock
- Select and lock the implementation language.
- Define the stable C ABI surface for lifecycle, inference, embeddings, configuration, and errors.
- Map error codes and severity into ABI-safe types.
- Keep the repository free of source code, build scripts, and CI configuration.

## Explicitly Deferred
- Any implementation code or language bindings.
- Build system setup or repository skeleton.
- Tests, harnesses, or CI integration.
- Host adapters or Shoots integration.

If it is not listed above, it is out of scope.
