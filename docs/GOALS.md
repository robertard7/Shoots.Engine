# Goals

## Phase 0 Goals — Governance & Guardrails
- Verify required governance files are present.
- Keep repository free of code directories and source files.
- Keep repository free of CI and build tooling.
- Define the task board as the authoritative roadmap.

## Explicitly Deferred
- Core engine implementation
- Language, ABI, or error model decisions
- Build system setup
- Inference or embedding APIs beyond documentation
- Tests, harnesses, or CI integration
- Host adapters or Shoots integration

If it is not listed above, it is out of scope for Phase 0.
