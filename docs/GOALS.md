# Goals

## Phase 3 Goals — Repository Skeleton (Minimal)
- Define a minimal source layout with public vs internal separation.
- Provide a build system skeleton for static and shared libraries.
- Publish public header stubs matching the ABI contract.
- Keep the repository free of implementation logic.

## Explicitly Deferred
- Any inference or embedding implementation.
- Full engine runtime behavior.
- Tests, harnesses, or CI integration.
- Host adapters or Shoots integration.

If it is not listed above, it is out of scope.
