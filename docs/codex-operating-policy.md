## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.

**Phase 2 (Language + ABI Lock) is active.** The repository must:
- Contain documentation artifacts only.
- Contain no source code, build scripts, or CI configuration.
- Treat the task board as the authoritative roadmap.
- Deliver locked language and ABI contracts before any implementation work.

Everything else comes later.
