## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.

**Phase 1 (Core Runtime Contract) is documentation-only.** The repository must:
- Contain documentation artifacts only.
- Contain no source code, build scripts, or CI configuration.
- Treat the task board as the authoritative roadmap.
- Deliver the Phase 1 contract documents before any implementation work.

Everything else comes later.
