## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.

**Phase 0 (Governance & Guardrails) is locked first.** The repository must:
- Contain required governance files only.
- Contain no source code, build scripts, or CI configuration.
- Treat the task board as the authoritative roadmap.

**Phase 1 (Core Runtime Contract) is documentation-only.** When Phase 0 is complete, Phase 1 adds:
- Engine lifecycle contract documentation.
- Inference API contract documentation.
- Embedding API contract documentation.
- Configuration surface documentation.
- Error model documentation.

Everything else comes later.
