## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.

**Phase 3 (Repository Skeleton) is active.** The repository must:
- Include only minimal build scaffolding and header stubs.
- Contain no functional engine implementation.
- Treat the task board as the authoritative roadmap.
- Preserve deterministic, embeddable constraints.

Everything else comes later.
